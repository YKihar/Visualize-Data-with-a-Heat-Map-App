# Global Land-Surface Temperature Heat Map Project

This project visualizes global land-surface temperature data from 1753 to 2015 using an interactive heat map. It's built with D3.js and fetches data from a freeCodeCamp API endpoint.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML
*   CSS
*   JavaScript
*   D3.js (v5)

## Data Source

The data is sourced from the freeCodeCamp Project API: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/global-temperature.json`

## Features

*   Interactive heat map displaying monthly global land-surface temperatures.
*   Color-coded cells representing temperature variations.
*   Tooltips displaying the year, month, and temperature for each cell on hover.
*   Legend explaining the color scale.

## How to Run

1.  Save the HTML as `index.html`, the CSS as `style.css`, and the JavaScript as `script.js` in the same directory.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
